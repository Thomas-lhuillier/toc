    "content"  : "<p>ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no built in framework for contextualizing events. Directives on how to interact were provided by 'scripts', written originally in MAD-Slip, which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots, but was also regarded as one of the first programs capable of passing the Turing Test.</p><p>ELIZA's creator, Weizenbaum regarded the program as a method to show the superficiality of communication between man and machine, but was surprised by the number of individuals who attributed human-like feelings to the computer program, including Weizenbaum’s secretary. Many academics believed that the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many people, particularly those suffering from psychological issues and that it could aid doctors working on such patients’ treatment. While ELIZA was capable of engaging in discourse, ELIZA could not converse with true understanding. However, many early users were convinced of ELIZA’s intelligence and understanding, despite Weizenbaum’s insistence to the contrary.</p>"

The 52-year-old president was driving a bus through a crowd in the central state of Aragua last weekend when the fruit was thrown at him.</p><p>“It says: ‘If you can, call me,’” said Maduro, who once drove a bus for a living, as he displayed the fruit on television. A scrawled message was visible. “Marleny Olivo had a problem with her house. [Officials] called her. She was scared. She couldn’t believe it was true … I’ve approved an apartment for you, Marleny, as part of the Grand Venezuelan Housing Mission.” He also promised that he would eat the mango.</p><p>Venezuela’s ever ebullient cybersphere did not miss a beat, with the president’s populist gesture drawing admiration and derision, plus plenty of jokes. “If for a mango they give you apartments, then you know what to do: throw him a pineapple!” quipped Dolar Today, a website that quotes the black market for dollars and is hated by Maduro.</p><p>Like his predecessor Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, Maduro is presented with many petitions during his trips, although most are written on paper rather than hurled at him on fruit. </p><p>In a habit that delights many poor supporters but irritates critics, Maduro – like Chávez – often personally gives away homes, appliances or pensions to low-income Venezuelans. However, lacking Chávez’s charm and good fortune with high oil prices, Maduro’s popularity has plummeted since he took office.</p><p>About 28.2% of Venezuelans approved of his management of the country in April, according to pollster Datanalisis. That was up from 24.7% in March, probably due to his campaign against US sanctions on seven government officials, but still nearly half the level when he became president. </p><p>The survey said that 45.8% planned to vote for opposition candidates in this year’s parliamentary election, while only 25% support the ruling Socialists. </p><p>Shortages of food and medicine caused by strict currency controls have taken a heavy toll, particularly on the poor, who traditionally have supported “Chavismo”. “A mango shortage is coming, let’s line up to throw them at Maduro and get a new house!” one Twitter user joked.</p>"

A new emoji pack wants to make discussing such challenges as easy as choosing an icon.</p><p>BRIS, a Swedish non-profit children’s rights organization that offers helpline services for children in need, has developed Abused Emoji, an app intended to help young people communicate their emotions, experiences, and struggles using variations on popular emoji.</p><p>“Kids issues range from issues about how to fit in or feeling awkward to really dark and heartbreaking stories about violence, sexual abuse, grooming, bullying and suicidal thoughts,” says Sylvia Ernhagen, the group’s director of communication and advocacy. “A lot of kids in society feel really awful for all kind of different reasons, and Abused Emoji are easily understood symbols for some of these different issues.”</p><p>Because communicating via emoji is second nature for many children and teens, the idea is they might find it easier to use emoji to express their feelings. Sometimes, conveying such things in words can be difficult, if not damaging. These emoji may help those suffering from abuse or trauma reach out for help earlier. If they can’t finds the words, perhaps they can find the symbols.</p><p>The Abused Emoji set includes many images that resemble Unicode emoji but have been modified to portray injuries (a child with a black eye or a bandage) or difficult situations (such as a child between two parents and a glass of wine or beer).</p><p>“Emoji are a very natural way for children and teenagers to communicate, and we want to show that there’s nothing wrong with reaching out when you feel down,” Ernhagen said. “We think that many times when you experience trouble it can be hard to put words on the situation, and these emojis can make it easier to reach out for help.” There are many Internet resources for people struggling with depression, abuse, and bullying, but the democratizing the language of communication, and not just the platform of communication, could draw more people out of the shadows. It’s an attempt to make often difficult or even taboo subjects that much more “OK” to talk about.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced. Gregory Leskin, director for the NCTSN Military and Veteran Families Program at the UCLA/Duke University National Center for Child Trauma, worries about the potential misuse, ambiguity, limitations, and context of the app.</p><p>Leskin said he feels positively about “developmentally appropriate” tools, and efforts to develop a set of graphics that help children communicate with professionals and adults about traumatic experiences. Leskin has found children “feel comfortable with technology as a way to express themselves.”</p>"

    "content"  : "<p>Victorians used flowers a lot like we use emoji.</p><p>Imagine for a moment that a messenger shows up at the door of your elegantly-appointed Victorian home and hands you a small, ribbon-wrapped bouquet, obviously hand-assembled from somebody’s garden. As an inhabitant of the 21st century, your natural inclination is to be charmed by the gift, and to search for an appropriate vase. As a wealthy inhabitant of the 19th century, your instinct is a little different: you rush for your flower dictionary to decode the secret meaning behind the arrangement.</p><p>If it’s a mix of lupins, hollyhocks, white heather, and ragged robin, somebody’s impressed with your imaginative wit and wishes you good luck in all your ambitions. By contrast, a collection of delphiniums, hydrangeas, oleander, basil, and birdsfoot trefoil means you’re heartless (hydrangea) and haughty (delphinium), and I hate you (basil). Beware (oleander) my revenge (birdsfoot trefoil)—the ultimate passive aggressive present.</p><p>Maybe somebody sent you a mix of geraniums to ask whether they can expect to see you at the next dance. If you have any striped carnations blooming in your conservatory, you can send them to the enquirer to say, “afraid not.” Victorian flower language, or floriography, was the pre-digital version of emoji; not much separates a bouquet of flowers implying you are skipping a party from a party ghost. </p><p>Like any symbol-based code, part of the appeal was deniability: in some flower dictionaries, the white cardamines I wore to my father’s wedding mean “paternal error”, while other dictionaries say they mean “ardor.” (I just thought they were fresh and lovely.) In the 1890s, Oscar Wilde famously asked his friends and supporters to wear green carnations which he simultaneously hinted would represent homosexuality and claimed had no meaning at all.</p><p>The long-lasting floriography fad was set off by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a feminist poet married to the English ambassador to Turkey. Letters she wrote home from Constantinople in 1717 and 1718 not only argued in favor of smallpox inoculation, but included an enthusiastic description of the Turkish selam (“hello”)—a secret flower language used by clever harem women to communicate under the noses of their guards.</p>"

Something “uplifting”.</p><p>The bigger PotatoParcel, founded by Riad Bekhit, has a claim to be both the first, and the largest, potato-sending company in the game. With between 25 and 50 orders a day, Bekhit told the Guardian that his company was processing between $10k and $20k every month in sales.</p><p>“It’s the art of surprise,” Bekhit explains when asked about the appeal of sending a message on a potato. “The messages can be anonymous so when people open the package and it says ‘happy birthday’, ‘I miss you’, ‘I love you’, people get a real kick out of it because it’s something they haven’t seen before.” The company has also been franchised out, he said, with local “ambassadors” in the UK, continental Europe, Australia and Canada.</p><p>“There’s been a few copiers and they copied us after seeing our stuff,” Bekhit says of the competition. “I mean, if you search in Google for ‘send a potato’ or ‘potato message’, we pop up first, so we’re getting all the Google traffic for search.”</p><p>“Other people are trying to copy our idea and offer potatoes with messages on them. [But] we’re the frontrunners,” he added.</p><p>Kelly downplayed the competitive aspect of the market. “Among the three potato-sending companies, we each have our different space and our different sub-niche,” he said. “So there isn’t any underhanded competition going on, but there are times when other businesses will crop up that will attempt to get into the space.”</p><p>Mark Rojek, one of Bekhit’s best customers, told the Guardian that he and his wife had struggled with Christmas cards until, last year, he discovered Potato Parcel. “I think it’s fun to throw people a curveball now and again and this fulfilled that plan perfectly,” he said.</p><p>He told his wife that he had fixed their Christmas card problem. She rolled her eyes. But when Christmas day came around, people started texting them, or posting pictures on Facebook with their potato. Each one had “we forgot to buy cards so here’s a potato. Merry Christmas from the Rojek family” printed neatly on it.</p><p>What Rojek liked was that it was a “warmer” way of communicating than a text or short email. “It’s not the cheapest way to do holiday cards,” he said. “But I guarantee it was the only potato people received.”</p><p>Kelly and Bekhit both said they consider their companies “gag-gift retailers” rather than potato-only ventures. Bekhit’s company now offers a “potato postcard” feature where you can upload an image and they will print it directly onto the side; for Christmas this year they experimented with holiday-themed gifts - a potato Christmas-tree decoration, or a lump of coal.</p><p>Kelly said that they too had experimented with other message vehicles, like carrots, but that the basics remained the most popular.“We tried yams,” he said. “But yams are basically potatoes.”"

Using thousands of hours of TV footage from the BBC, scientists trained a neural network to annotate video footage with 46.8 percent accuracy. That might not seem that impressive at first — especially compared to AI accuracy rates when transcribing audio — but tested on the same footage, a professional human lip-reader was only able to get the right word 12.4 percent of the time.</p><p>The research follows similar work published by a separate group at the University of Oxford earlier this month. Using related techniques, these scientist were able to create a lip-reading program called LipNet that achieved 93.4 percent accuracy in tests, compared to 52.3 percent human accuracy. However, LipNet was only tested on specially-recorded footage that used volunteers speaking formulaic sentences. By comparison, DeepMind’s software — known as “Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell” — was tested on far more challenging footage; transcribing natural, unscripted conversations from BBC politics shows.</p>"

No, the illustration choice that they rejected was the flesh-toned skin of the medical diagram’s human form. ‘It was considered pornographic,’ says Alan Stillman, founder and CEO of the visual communications company Kwikpoint. ‘People wouldn’t use it and didn’t like it because they’re so religious there.’</p>"

Neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, but Voyager 1 will pass within 1.6 light-years of the star Gliese 445, currently in the constellation Camelopardalis, in about 40,000 years.[1]</p><p>Carl Sagan noted that \"The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space.
